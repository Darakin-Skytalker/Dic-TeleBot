# Merriam-Webster Telegram Dictionary Bot ðŸ“š

This is a Telegram bot that gives you dictionary features like:
- Definitions
- Pronunciation (symbolic form)
- Rhymes
- Examples
- Etymology
- Kids Definition
- Phrase Containing

## How it works

Users send a word, and the bot responds with a menu of options. Clicking a button sends the user the selected information scraped from www.Merriam-Webster.com .

## Note

a dictionary like Merriam-Webster uses various parts of speech to categorize the definition of the words. For example, noun, verb, adjective, etc. This bot includes 8 parts of speech, namely: Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Preposition, Pronoun, Abbreviation, and Conjunction. There are still some other parts of speech like: Interjection(e.g. 'wow', 'hi'), Article(e.g. 'an', 'the'), Suffix, Prefix, Symbol, Geographical Name, Biographical Name, etc. For now, I skipped including these less common parts of speech in this bot.
